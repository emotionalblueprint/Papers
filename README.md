## Papers

### Empirical Validation of the Four-Mode Gradient Framework
Computational analysis of 10,000+ natural conflict narratives (Reddit AITA posts) testing whether the four-mode gradient can be reliably detected in unstructured text.

**Key findings:**
- All four regulatory modes successfully detected using polyvagal markers, contempt markers, and moral disengagement markers
- 33.8% of individuals escalated toward Control/Domination when challenged
- 22.2% de-escalated toward Connection
- De-escalators showed 78% higher rates of complexity markers than escalators

### TEG-Blue Theoretical Architecture Contribution Record
Documentation of the theoretical foundations integrating 139+ established theories across neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and trauma studies.

## The Framework

TEG-Blue maps nervous system regulatory states along a gradient:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Connection** | Safety perceived; open, relational |
| **Protection** | Threat perceived; defensive but recoverable |
| **Control** | Chronic threat managed through controlling others |
| **Domination** | Control entrenched; power as only safety |

**Core claim:** The key variable predicting relational outcomes is not current regulatory state, but capacity to return to Connection when challenged.
